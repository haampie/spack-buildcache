# Spack buildcache for GitHub Actions

This repo provides a buildcache to speed up Spack in your GitHub Actions.

Currently it provides binaries from Spack `develop` for

- `%gcc@11 ^glibc@2.31 target=x86_64_v3`
- `%clang@12 ^glibc@2.31 target=x86_64_v3`

which supports the following distros:

- Ubuntu 20.04 and later
- Debian 11 and later
- RHEL 9 and later
- Fedora 32 and later

To use it, add an environment `spack.yaml` to the root of your own repository

```yaml
spack:
  view: my_view
  specs:
  - python@3.11

  config:
    install_tree:
      root: /opt/spack

  packages:
    all:
      require: 'target=x86_64_v3'
```

and Spack install it in a GitHub Action:

```yaml
name: Build

on: push

jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    - name: Setup Spack
      uses: spack/setup-spack@v2

    - name: Concretize
      run: spack -e . concretize

    - name: Install
      run: spack -e . install --no-check-signature

    - name: Run
        run: ./my_view/bin/python -c 'print("hello world")'
```

## Caching your own binaries

If you want to cache your own binaries too, there are three steps to take:

1. Use padding in the install root, and add an additional mirror to `spack.yaml`:

   ```yaml
   spack:
     config:
       install_tree:
         root: /opt/spack
         padded_length: 128
     mirrors:
       local-buildcache: oci://ghcr.io/<username>/spack-buildcache
   ```

2. Configure the permissions for `GITHUB_TOKEN`:

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     example:
       runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
       permissions:
         packages: write
   ```

3. Add an extra job step that pushes installed Spack packages to the local
   buildcache:

   ```yaml
   jobs:
     example:
       steps:
       - name: Push packages and update index
         run: |
           spack -e . mirror set --push --oci-username ${{ github.actor }} --oci-password "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" local-buildcache
           spack -e . buildcache push --base-image ubuntu:22.04 --unsigned --update-index local-buildcache
         if: ${{ !cancelled() }}
   ```
   NOTE: Make sure to add `if: ${{ !cancelled() }}`, so that binaries for successfully
   installed packages are available also when a dependent fails to build.

### Caching your own binaries in *private* repos and buildcaches

When your local buildcache is stored in a private GitHub package,
you need to specify the OCI credentials already *before* `spack concretize`.
This is because Spack needs to fetch the buildcache index. Also, remember to
remove the `--push` flag from `spack mirror set`, since fetching needs
credentials too:

```yaml
jobs:
  example-private:
    steps:
    - name: Login
      run: spack -e . mirror set --oci-username ${{ github.actor }} --oci-password "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}" local-buildcache

    - name: Concretize
      run: spack -e . concretize

    - name: Install
      run: spack -e . install --no-check-signature

    - name: Push packages and update index
      run: spack -e . buildcache push --base-image ubuntu:22.04 --unsigned --update-index local-buildcache
```

From a security perspective, notice that the `GITHUB_TOKEN` is exposed to every
subsequent job step. (This is no different from `docker login`, which also likes
to store credentials in the home directory.)

## Contributing

If you want to make more packages available, contribute to
[spack.yaml](spack.yaml).

## Build strategy

Since compiling software in GitHub actions is relatively slow, this stack is
built using `concretizer:reuse:dependencies`. That means that the latest
versions of the packages listed in [spack.yaml](spack.yaml) are built, but
their dependencies are only updated when a package compatibility rule requires
it. The stack is currently built on demand, not on a schdule.
